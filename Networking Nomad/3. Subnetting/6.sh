echo "When we are working on our network, does that mean the internet can see our IP address? Not quite."
echo
echo "In this architecture. NAT makes a device like router and makes beyond of it as private network. So single IP address is enough for our Subnet to interact with internet"

echo "Think of NAT as a receptionist in a large office. If someone wants to contact you, they only know the number to the whole office. The receptionist would then have to look for your extension number and forward the call to you."

echo "How does it work?"
echo
echo "1. Patty wants to connect to www.google.com, so her machine sends this request through the router."
echo "2. The router takes that request and opens its own connection to google.com, then it sends Patty's request once it makes a connection."
echo "3. The router is the intermediary between Patty and www.google.com. Google doesn't know about Patty; instead, all it can see is the router."
