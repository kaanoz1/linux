# Linux Learning Journey 🚀🐧

This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I learn **Linux** using [LinuxJourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com).  
My primary goal is to build a strong foundation in Linux system administration, command-line usage, networking, and related concepts.

I will use this repository to document notes, exercises, and examples for each section and subsection provided in the Linux Journey roadmap. This will serve both as a personal learning tracker and as a knowledge base I can revisit anytime.

---

## Purpose

- To learn Linux systematically from beginner to advanced topics.
- To document my learning journey step by step.
- To organize my notes based on the **LinuxJourney** sections.
- To use GitHub as a progress tracker and study resource.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to mirror the sections and subsections of LinuxJourney.com. Each main section has its own folder, and inside it, each subsection has a dedicated subfolder. Notes, commands, and exercises will be recorded within those folders.

## How I Will Use This Repo

- Each **subsection folder** will contain a `README.md` file with:
  - Notes from the lessons
  - Important commands and their explanations
  - Exercises and examples I practice
- I may also include shell scripts, configuration files, or diagrams when needed.

## 📌 Goals

- Achieve proficiency in Linux fundamentals.
- Prepare for **RHCSA**, **CompTIA Linux+**, and **CompTIA Network+** certifications.
- Build practical Linux skills by practicing with **Playground environments** like Ubuntu, RHEL, Kali, and Docker.
